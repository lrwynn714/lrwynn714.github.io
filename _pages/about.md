I am a **doctoral student** in the Department of Dermatology at [Peking University Medical School](https://www.bjmu.edu.cn/), specializing in clinical dermatology. My current main research direction is in dermatology, particularly related to melanoma, and I am very interested in single-cell sequencing and other aspects.


My Research Focus: Focusing on Unmet Clinical Needs
------
My scientific journey began with a focus on a specific issue: acral melanoma. As a subtype with a relatively higher incidence rate in Asian populations, there are still many unknowns in its molecular mechanisms and treatment strategies waiting to be explored. To tackle this challenge, my work mainly revolves around the following aspects:

Single-cell sequencing analysis
------
I firmly believe that understanding the essence of tumors requires delving into the level of individual cells. By using tools like R language to deeply mine single-cell sequencing data, I am committed to drawing a detailed map of the tumor microenvironment, identifying key cell subpopulations and their interactions, and thus finding potential therapeutic targets.

Integrating multi-omics data and database mining
------
From obtaining information from public databases such as GEO, SEER, to planning a Meta-analysis on acral melanoma, my goal is to stand on the shoulders of giants, through integrating and comparing the research achievements of predecessors, to form a more comprehensive and reliable scientific insight.

Exploration of molecular mechanisms:
------
The end of data analysis is the answer to biological problems. I have a strong interest in the signaling pathways behind tumor invasiveness, such as the Hippo-YAP pathway, and I continue to track the latest developments in this field, trying to closely link computational results with biological functions.

My Technical Toolbox: An Interdisciplinary Problem-Solver
------
I believe that breakthrough insights often emerge at the intersection of disciplines. Therefore, I continuously refine my technical stack to ensure that I can calmly face challenges in different fields.

Programming and data analysis
------
R language is my most trusted partner in medical statistics and bioinformatics analysis; Python is my tool for data processing and process automation; and my learning of SQL comes from a try in exploring the field of business analysis, which has exercised my ability to structure queries and process large-scale data.

A Different Practice of Scientific Spirit
Finally, I would like to talk about the website you are currently browsing. It is not just a static personal homepage, but also a project full of "research spirit." It started with a simple idea: to create a platform that can clearly display my academic trajectory. However, from the moment I wrote the first line of custom CSS code, I and an AI assistant embarked on a long and interesting debugging journey together.

We have tracked down "missing" style files, debugged the entire site compilation failure caused by a misplaced line of code, and deeply explored modern development processes such as Gemfile dependency management and GitHub Actions continuous integration. This process is very similar to scientific research itself: proposing hypotheses, conducting hands-on tests, facing failures, analyzing logs, locating the root cause, and finally finding a solution after countless iterations.
